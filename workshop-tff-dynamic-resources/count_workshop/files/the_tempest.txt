GONZALO
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO
The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEBASTIAN
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.
